# General Purpose
This repository is based on the [Lean 4 Project Template](https://github.com/pitmonticone/LeanProject). In general I am working on formalising a part of my Bsc. Thesis in this repo as another part of my Bsc. thesis. Thus I will most likely ignore any PR's/comments (see also for more details[`.CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)). I will most likely after I am done with my Bsc. thesis work on proving other stuff in Lean, so any suggestions of projects to work on would be nice!
