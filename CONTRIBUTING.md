# Contributing to [Project]

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Project]! We welcome contributions from the
community and appreciate your efforts to improve the project. Please follow the guidelines below
to ensure a smooth contribution process.

1. Keep in mind that this is part of a Bsc. thesis. Therefore I would only like getting suggestions to help me learn to use Lean and won't merge solutions to theorems into my repo. However much I would enjoy this project to be a community project for now.
2. Hints for proof methods or cleanup are welcome after I have proven theorems. However there is a big chance that most suggestions will be ignored by the fact that I also want to explain how proofs work e.g. sometimes `ring`{:.lean} would have solved a theorem, but then I would lose the oppertunity of explaining what goes on under the hood.

TLDR: There is a good chance I won't merge your suggestions into my codebase.
